# Safe-Folder-Application

# Introduction 

Data is the most crucial part of any system in the current world and there are countless ways to store and access data. But not every method is safe due to the various attackers trying to get hold of information for many reasons. This puts the privacy of the user at risk. To protect any crucial information of a user it can be encrypted but cannot be entirely protected

# Idea

The discussion starts by highlighting the importance of information security and the risks associated with data breaches. It then discusses the challenges associated with secure data storage and proposes various security measures such as access controls, encryption, and authentication mechanisms to mitigate the risk of data breaches. The discussion then moves on to the challenges associated with analyzing sensitive data while preserving its security

# Features of our project

(i)	Confidentiality: The data should be kept confidential and protected from unauthorized access or disclosure. This can be achieved through encryption and access control mechanism <br>
(ii)	Integrity: The data should be protected from unauthorized modification or tampering. This can be achieved through data integrity checks and digital signatures <br>
(iii)	Availability: The data should be available to authorized users when needed. This can be achieved through redundancy and fault-tolerant mechanisms <br>
(iv)	Accuracy: The data should be accurate and reliable. This can be achieved through data validation and verification mechanisms <br>
(v)	Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle increasing amounts of data and users. This can be achieved through distributed architectures and load balancing mechanisms <br>
(vi)	Performance: The system should provide fast and responsive access to data. This can be achieved through efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms <br>
(vii)	Usability: The system should be easy to use and manage. This can be achieved through user-friendly interfaces and administrative tools <br>

# Procedure 

(i) Use of black box design approach for secured data storage and analysis using blockchain would provide a user-friendly and secure solution for the storage and analysis of sensitive data, without requiring users to have any knowledge or understanding of the internal workings of the system <br>
(ii) The low level design specifies the the storage infrastructure and the tools to be used. It address the security and privacy concerns like the implementation of appropriate encryption and access control mechanisms and the design of a secure communication protocol
